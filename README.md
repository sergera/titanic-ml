## Predicting Survival Aboard the Titanic!

<p>This is my first shot at Machine Learning, I'm really excited about it, in the moment I'm trying to climb the ranks at Kaggle.</p>

<p>This project uses <a href="https://trufflesuite.com/">PreSci</a> as a submodule, it's a package I'm working on to easily handle data analysis and feature engineering!</p>

<p>I plan to update this project, maybe even turn it into an API and learn how to serve an ML model in production.</p>
