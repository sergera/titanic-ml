## Predicting Survival Aboard the Titanic!

This is my first shot at Machine Learning, I'm really excited about it, in the moment I'm trying to climb the ranks at Kaggle.

This project uses PreSci as a submodule, it's a package I'm working on to easily handle data analysis and feature engineering!

I plan to update this project, maybe even turn it into an API and learn how to serve an ML model in production.
